# This command will:
# 1. Download wsdl.xml to /app/src/main/resources/wsdl.xml (via download-maven-plugin)
# 2. Modify /app/src/main/resources/wsdl.xml (via replacer-plugin)
# 3. Generate JAX-WS sources using /app/src/main/resources/wsdl.xml (via jaxws-maven-plugin).
#    The generated client code will expect wsdl.xml on the classpath.
# 4. Compile all sources.
# 5. Package resources from /app/src/main/resources (which should include wsdl.xml) into the JAR.
# 6. Create the final executable JAR.
